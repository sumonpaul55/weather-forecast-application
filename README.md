## Getting Started

weather forecast application

First, run the development server:

create an .env.local file in root directory and past the following code

# use https://openweathermap.org/api api for get cities weather 
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API=a3be88a7e22ea686e63a0493ce9d4bde

```bash
npm install

npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
